Hi! My name is Guilherme Shimabuko (gshimabuko) and I am an Electrical Engineer
from Brazil!

I worked for the past seven years with ASICs and Embedded Systems and I love 
writing code, be it hardware description, firmware or "plain" software!

Most of my work was done under NDAs, but I am currently working on building an
open portfolium!

At the moment, I am working as a private contractor for a research project, but
I am available to discuss new opportunities!
