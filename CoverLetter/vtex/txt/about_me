I am an Electrical Engineer who loves writing code in all of its forms. I've worked with embedded software, firmware, hardware description languages and "plain" software. One of the most interesting projects I've worked at was an internship that latter became my dissertation project. It was a recommendation system for physical exercises that included all of it. Artificial Intelligence, a Java frontend, embedded software, MySQL Databases and many other technologies. 

I enjoy a good challenge and I am very passionate about my work. I believe in giving my best at everything I do and that there is always room for improvement, so I am constantly trying to learn new things!
