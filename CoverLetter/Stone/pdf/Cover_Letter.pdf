    Subject: Application for the Digital Design and Verification Engineer job 
    oppening.

    \setlength\parindent{12pt}
    \vspace{1mm}

    Recently graduated as an Electrical Engineer, I have a strong interest in 
    Electronics and Computer Systems and I take a special interest in Digital 
    Electronics, a field in which I am currently taking classes towards a Graduate
    Certificate at the University of Colorado - Boulder, which is why I was elated
    to hear of this opportunity. I am positive that my experiences as an 
    undergraduate intern and now as a research assistant will meet your 
    expectations for this post.\par

    During my time at the university, I looked for every opportunity to gain more
    knowledge and experience in both management and technical fields. As a member 
    of the Junior Enterprise, I had the chance to learn a lot about project 
    management and team work, skills that I carried into every post I occupied 
    since. The Junior Enterprise was also where I received a referral for my 
    first R\&D internship at a University Laboratory to develop electronic 
    prototypes for Technology and Arts exchibits. While the main focus of my 
    advisor at this job was purely artistic, this project grew into a larger 
    system, which later became my graduation dissertation. This first internship 
    turned into other opportunities at two other laboratories, as well as an 
    internship at a small Integrated Circuits Design firm (DFChip), where I 
    learned the foundation of Digital Integrated Circuits and FPGA design that 
    allowed me to get to where I am today.\par

    My last internship was as an undergraduate research assistant working for
    a public-private partnership between a Brazilian Federal University and a
    Multinational company in the development of a new technological product.
    I was responsible for assembling, training and managing an IC design team
    which would verify and validate the FPGA Prototype designs and then turn
    them into IC designs for the final product. This experience, as well
    as my experience at DFChip were both heavily focused on simulation, validation
    and testing. After I graduated, I was hired as an independent contrator to
    continue the work I was doing as an intern. I was the IC design leader for
    this project for a little over a year and a half. Out of that time, I worked
    30 hours a week for the first year, and full time for the past six months.
    \par

    As the project I am currently working on is coming to an end due to the 
    COVID-19 pandemic, I am currently looking for a new opportunity to develop 
    as and Enginner and to keep funding my studies, and I believe this post
    would be a perfect match for my personal and professional interests and
    habilities. I would be thrilled to be considered for a position at such a
    highly regarded company in my field and I hope to be able to demonstrate
    my potential to you all.
